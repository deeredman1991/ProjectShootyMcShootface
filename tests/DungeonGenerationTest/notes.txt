Ideas:
	- Monty Hall:
		A room with connections on the east and west called the "Monty Hall" ran by an NPC named "Monty"
		You can win 1 item or 1 of 2 "zonks". A zonk may be an enemy spawn or a common valueless item.
		There are 3 buttons one representing the item and 2 representing the zonks. When you press a button
		you will be shown one of the two outcomes that you did not choose. You can then switch to another
		button or stick with your choice where you will then be awarded the item or the zonk and the buttons are disabled.
		
	- Casino:
		A room with 4 coin slots that represent coin flips HH, TT, HT, TH.
		You pay 5 coins to play. The game flips 2 coins. If you lose you get nothing.
		If you win you get 21 coins because you have a 1 in 4 chance of winning: 20 coins is break even and 21 is a slight profit.
		Machines break after 1 win or a maximum of 3(?) plays.
		
	- Challenge Floor / Lost Floor
		A Lost Woods/Lost Cave style floor that gives the player a hint as to which direction to go and resets the floor upon taking a wrong turn.
